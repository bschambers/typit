DEFAULT TEXT FOLLOWS:

Bannana Man breaking the land speed record on his unicycle. He speeds across the
mud flats in a streak of blue and yellow. Close behind him is Gordon Ramsay in a
motorised bathtub, and in third place, Tony Blair riding Rod Hull and
Emu. Grotbags isn't taking part this year because she's going to a birthday
party hosted by Barbarella. It's windy out, so she's put on her fur hat and
fitted the aerodynamic body kit on her broomstick to reduce drag. Barbarella
won't be going to her own party because she just had some bad news - that Trevor
from One Direction still hasn't replied to her text message.

Meanwhile Jacob Rees-Mogg is touching up the paintwork on his life-sized Taj
Mahal replica. Moss green for the window frames, with mirror-tinted double
glazing inside the casements, and a lovely shade of mauve for all of the column
capitals. He built the thing over a period of two hundred million years out of
individually carved grains of rice, all fitted together with no mortar.
