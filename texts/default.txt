    [Lady Smart's Antichamber.

    Lady Smart and Lady Answerall at the Tea-table.

Lady Smart. My Lord, your Lordship's most humble Servant.

Ld. Sparkish. Madam, you spoke too late; I was your Ladyship's before.

Lady Smart. Oh! Colonel, are you here!

Col. As sure as you're there, Madam.

Lady Smart. Oh, Mr. Neverout! what, such a Man alive!

Neverout. Ay, Madam; alive, and alive like to be, at your Ladyship's
Service.

Lady Smart. Well: I'll get a Knife, and nick it down, that Mr.
Neverout came to our House. And pray, What News Mr. Neverout?

Neverout. Why, Madam, Queen Elizabeth's dead.

Lady Smart. Well, Mr. Neverout, I see you are no Changeling.

    [Miss Notable comes in.

Neverout. Miss, your Slave: I hope your early Rising will do you no
Harm. I hear you are but just come out of the Cloth-Market.

Miss. I always rise at Eleven, whether it be Day or no.

Col. Miss, I hope you are up for all Day?

Miss. Yes, if I don't get a Fall before Night.

Col. Miss, I heard you were out of Order; pray, how are you now?

Miss. Pretty well, Colonel, I thank you.

Col. Pretty and well, Miss! that's Two very good things.

Miss. I mean, I am better than I was.

Neverout. Why then, 'tis well you were sick.

Miss. What, Mr. Neverout; you take me up, before I'm down.

Lady Smart. Come, let us leave off Children's Play, and come to
Push-pin.

Miss [to Lady Smart.] Pray, Madam, give me some more Sugar to my Tea.

Col. Oh! Miss, you must needs be very good-humour'd, you love sweet
things so much.

Neverout. Stir it up with the Spoon, Miss; for the deeper the sweeter.

Lady Smart. I assure you, Miss, the Colonel has made you a great
Compliment.

Miss. I am sorry for it; for I have heard say, that complimenting is
lying.
